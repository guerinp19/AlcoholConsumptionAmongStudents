## Introduction:
 The data set we chose is about alcohol consumption among secondary school students, which is a topic normally associated with college/university students. However, this topic isn’t talked about often with secondary school students, which is why this dataset is so important. These two datasets were obtained by surveying the students of a math class and a Portuguese language class, they were surveyed about several attributes including sex, free time, quality of health, parent’s jobs, etc. These datasets were made by two students at the University of Camerino named Fabio Pagnotta and Hossain Mohammad Amran. This dataset can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption.
