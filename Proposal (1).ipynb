    "\n",
    "This data set (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption) provides information about student alcohol consumption and several factors that could lead to an increase in drinking among the youth. The data was collected by a survey conducted by two university students in Italy who surveyed local secondary school students who took either math or Portuguese language classes. The dataset includes information about the students family situations, the students age and performance in the class and the amount of alcohol they typically consume on weekends and on weekdays on a scale from 1 to 5.  It is also worth noting that the data set is spit up into different tables one for each class meaning there is a table for the math students surveyed and a table for the Portuguese language students surveyed.\n",

    "- Determining how likely a student is to fail a class.\n",

    "- Determining which students are more susceptible to alcoholism based on how much they will typically consume.\n",

    "**Why did you choose this data set over the others?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set provided had many different variables related to students that drink and don’t drink, which we found interesting. For example, the “failures” variable seems to correlate with academic performance regarding students’ relationship with alcohol, and the “go out” variable may relate to if students tend to drink with their peers more when they go out. Overall, we found that the variables allowed us to make much more connections and conclusions with the data compared to other data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Were there any other datasets we found interesting?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We came across a data set regarding movies from a large year range. We found this one interesting because it included budgets for these movies as well as ratings and genre. Therefore, we thought that finding correlations between budget and ratings would be interesting to investigate, amongst other things as well.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which ages drink the most? To find this, we will look at the age group of the students that drink, and find a few age numbers where drinking is more common.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do students who drink more get lower grades? Find the number of students that drink and compare their average grades to the average of the kids that don’t drink, as well as the total number of failures from kids that drink vs. kids that don’t.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do more socially active students drink more? Check if the sociable students that have more freetime have a tendency to drink more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If they drink more, then do they miss more classes? Check for absences from students that drink compared to absences of students that don’t drink and draw conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does drinking affect the students’ health? Compare the health of students that don’t drink to the health of students that do drink.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does family size impact whether or not the student will drink? Compare the large family sizes of kids that drink, to the small family sizes  of kids that drink and see if there’s a trend / pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a student has at least one parent working their job from home, then are they more likely to drink alcohol? Take all the data of kids with at least one parent that works from home, and check if it's common for the kid to drink alcohol.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do you see any potential for data science applications?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can graph the data according to our 5 questions and look for trends / correlations between the variables and how they impact students’ alcohol consumption or lack thereof. We can also find the general linear equation from the graphs if possible and find an equation that represents the trend(s) that we see.\n",
